# Problem Statement

The classification of dry bean varieties based on parameters extracted through image processing techniques poses several challenges that require further investigation. This research aims to address two key problem areas in this domain: feature importance and hyperparameter tuning. By addressing these issues, this study aims to enhance the accuracy and robustness of dry bean classification models. Firstly, determining the importance of features extracted from images is crucial for improving the performance of classification models. While numerous image processing techniques can extract various features, it remains unclear which features are most relevant for accurate classification. The identification of key features will enable researchers to focus on the most informative aspects of the images, facilitating the development of more efficient and effective classification algorithms. By exploring the importance of different features and their impact on classification accuracy, this research will contribute to the advancement of dry bean classification systems.

Secondly, hyperparameter tuning plays a vital role in optimizing the performance of classification models. Selecting appropriate values for hyperparameters, such as learning rates, regularization terms, and batch sizes, significantly affects the model's ability to generalize and classify unseen dry bean samples accurately. However, the process of hyperparameter tuning is complex and time-consuming, requiring systematic exploration of various parameter combinations. By investigating different hyperparameter tuning approaches and evaluating their impact on classification accuracy, this research aims to provide insights into improving the efficiency and effectiveness of dry bean classification models. To address these research problems, this study will utilize a publicly available dataset obtained from Kaggle, consisting of a diverse range of dry bean images. Through an in-depth analysis of feature importance and rigorous experimentation with hyperparameter tuning techniques, the research aims to propose novel methodologies that can improve the classification accuracy of dry bean varieties. The findings of this study will contribute to the development of more reliable and efficient dry bean classification systems, benefiting agricultural research, farmers, and food industries involved in dry bean production and distribution.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this study is sourced from Kaggle and consists of a collection of
morphological attributes of dry beans. For the classification model, images of 13,611
grains of 7 different registered dry beans were taken with a high-resolution camera. Bean
images obtained by the computer vision system were subjected to segmentation and
feature extraction stages, and a total of 16 features; 12 dimensions and 4 shape forms,
were obtained from the grains. It provides valuable information for developing a Dry Bean
Classification System that aims to optimize cultivation practices and provide personalized
classification for dry bean farmers.
The dataset contains observations of dry beans, with each instance represented by various
numerical attributes. The included attributes are as follows:

1. Area: The area of the bean.
2. Perimeter: The perimeter length of the bean.
3. MajorAxisLength: The length of the major axis of the bean.
4. MinorAxisLength: The length of the minor axis of the bean.
5. AspectRatio: Ratio of length of the major axis to the length of the minor axis.
6. Eccentricity: A measure of the deviation of the bean shape from a perfect circle.
7. ConvexArea: The area of the smallest convex polygon that can enclose the bean.
8. EquivDiameter: The diameter of a circle with the same area as the bean.
9. Extent: The ratio of the bean area to the convex area.
10. Solidity: The ratio of the bean area to the convex hull area.
11. Roundness: A measure of how closely the bean resembles a circle.
12. Compactness: A measure of how compact the bean shape is.
13. ShapeFactor1: A shape factor calculated using the area and perimeter.
14. ShapeFactor2: A shape factor calculated using the area and major axis length.
15. ShapeFactor3: A shape factor calculated using the area and minor axis length.
16. ShapeFactor4: A shape factor calculated using the area and eccentricity.

The dataset includes a categorical column called "Class," which represents the class label
of each bean. The class labels indicate the specific variety or type of dry bean, allowing for
classification tasks and the dry bean types are Sekaer, Barbunya, Bombay, Cali, Dermosan,
Horoz and Sira. By analyzing this dataset, the research aims to contribute to the
understanding of the morphological determinants of dry bean quality and provide practical

# Architecture

Data architecture involves starting with the data source, the dried beans dataset, and
understanding the schema and format of the dataset. We then apply data preprocessing
techniques to clean the data, handle missing values, outliers, and duplicates, and transform it into
a suitable format for analysis. This step ensures the quality and integrity of the data and makes it
ready for further processing.The data preparation phase focuses on splitting the data into training
and testing sets and performing cross-validation or training-validation splits for model
evaluation. Data architecture ensures proper partitioning and organisation of data subsets to
enable effective model training and scoring. During the data modelling phase, this architecture
makes it easy to integrate different machine learning models into your pipeline. This enables
seamless data flow between models and ensures compatibility between input data and model
requirements. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as well as
fitting analysis are calculated and analysed within the data architecture. This allows efficient
computation and comparison of model performance, providing insight into the effectiveness of
classification models. The data architecture also supports hyperparameter tuning to test and
evaluate different combinations of parameters. This process optimises model performance and
identifies the best set of hyperparameters for the selected model. Finally, data architecture plays a
key role in providing the best model for real-world applications. Supports model integration into
various deployment environments, including: B. A mobile app by ensuring smooth flow and
transformation of input data for classification. Overall, the data architecture of the dry bean
